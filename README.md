Drill Bit Visualizer 🛠️
A parametric drill bit visualization tool built using JavaScript and SVG, dynamically adjusting in real-time based on ISO13399 standards. This tool allows users to modify key drill bit dimensions—such as cutting diameter (DC), point angle (SIG), chip flute length (LCF), and overall length (OAL)—and see an accurate visual representation update instantly.
